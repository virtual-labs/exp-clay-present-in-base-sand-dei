      "explanations": {
        "a": "The experiment aims to determine the amount of clay present in the base sand by washing away the finer clay particles and measuring the weight difference before and after drying.",
        "b": "The experiment aims to determine the amount of clay present in the base sand by washing away the finer clay particles and measuring the weight difference before and after drying.",
        "c": "The experiment aims to determine the amount of clay present in the base sand by washing away the finer clay particles and measuring the weight difference before and after drying.",

      "question": "What is the role of a mechanical stirrer in the experiment? (LO2)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To mix sand with water and NaOH for uniform suspension",
        "b": "To increase the drying speed of the sand",
        "c": "To remove large impurities from the sand",
        "d": "To compact the sand for better accuracy"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The mechanical stirrer ensures thorough mixing of the sand, water, and NaOH solution, promoting the detachment of clay particles from the sand grains.",
        "b": "The mechanical stirrer ensures thorough mixing of the sand, water, and NaOH solution, promoting the detachment of clay particles from the sand grains.",

      "question": "How do you know when to stop the siphoning process? (LO2)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "When the water in the jar becomes clear",
        "b": "When the sand particles stop settling",
        "c": "When no more clay can be seen in the water",
        "d": "When the sand particles float in the jar"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The siphoning process is repeated multiple times until the water becomes clear, which indicates that most of the clay particles have been removed.",
        "b": "The siphoning process is repeated multiple times until the water becomes clear, which indicates that most of the clay particles have been removed.",
        "c": "The siphoning process is repeated multiple times until the water becomes clear, which indicates that most of the clay particles have been removed.",

    {
      "question": "How is the percentage of clay content calculated? (LO4)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "By dividing the initial weight of sand by the weight after drying",
        "b": "By subtracting the dried sand weight from the initial sand weight and using a formula",
        "c": "By measuring the volume of clay settled in the jar",
        "d": "By multiplying the wet sand weight by the oven temperature"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The clay content is determined using the formula by subtracting the dried sand weight from the initial sand weight and using a formula.",

    {
      "question": "What would happen if the sand is not completely dried before weighing? (LO2)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The clay content will be underestimated",
        "b": "The clay content will be overestimated",
        "c": "The sand weight will remain unchanged",
        "d": "The sand will dissolve in water"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "If the sand is not completely dried before weighing, some residual moisture may remain, making the sand weight appear higher than its actual dry weight.",
        "b": "If the sand is not completely dried before weighing, some residual moisture may remain, making the sand weight appear higher than its actual dry weight.",
        "c": "If the sand is not completely dried before weighing, some residual moisture may remain, making the sand weight appear higher than its actual dry weight.",
