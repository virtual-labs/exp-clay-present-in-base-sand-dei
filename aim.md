### Aim
To determine the clay content present in base sand.

### Learning Objectives:

LO1- To understand the Role of Clay in Moulding Sand – understanding how clay contributes to the binding strength, plasticity, and moisture retention of moulding sand and how its presence affects permeability.

LO2- To analyse the correct procedure for determining clay content – Performing the steps involved in measuring clay content, including mixing sand with NaOH solution, stirring, siphoning, drying, and weighing the sample.

LO3- To analyse the effect of clay content on mould properties – Identifying how varying clay percentages influence the strength, permeability, and potential casting defects in mould-making applications.

LO4- To calculate the percentage of clay content in base sand – Use the given formula to determine the clay percentage based on the difference between the initial and dried sand weights

### Material: 
Base sand, 5% NaoH solution and water

### Apparatus: 
Wash bottle, measuring jar, mechanical stirrer and siphon tube
