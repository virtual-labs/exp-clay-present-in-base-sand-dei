### Definition of Clay:
Clay is a fine-grained natural material with particle sizes smaller than 2 microns. It primarily consists of clay minerals, mainly aluminium silicates, and acts as a binding agent in moulding sand.

### Role of Clay in Moulding Sand:
Moulding sand typically contains 2% to 50% clay. The presence of clay provides the following characteristics:<br>
●	Binding Strength: Clay helps in holding the sand particles together, making the mould strong enough to retain its shape.<br>
●	Plasticity: When mixed with water, clay becomes plastic, meaning it can be moulded into various shapes without cracking.<br>
●	Moisture Retention: Due to its flake-like structure, clay has a large surface area, allowing it to hold and absorb moisture effectively.<br>
●	Effect on Permeability: If the clay content is too high, it reduces permeability, which means gases cannot escape easily, leading to defects in castings.

### Types of Clay Components in Moulding Sand:
1.	True Clay: This component provides the actual binding strength in the moulding sand.<br>
2.	Fine Silt: These are small particles that do not contribute to binding strength but are present in natural sands.

### Why is Clay Content Measurement Important?
Base sand obtained from a natural source contains some amount of clay, but this amount may not always be suitable for mould-making. Too much or too little clay can affect the quality of the mould.<br>
●	If clay content is too high, the mould becomes less permeable, trapping gases and causing casting defects.<br>
●	If clay content is too low, the mould loses strength, leading to breakage during handling.

To achieve the optimal clay percentage, the clay content test is performed.

### Principle of Clay Content Test:
The test works on the principle that when clay particles are suspended in water, they react with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to form a precipitate. The clay content is determined by separating, drying, and weighing the precipitate. This helps in deciding whether to add or remove clay from the base sand for proper mould-making.
