### Clay Content 
*Clay is extremely fine-grained natural soil material (with < 2 microns size) containing clay minerals (aluminum silicate), which acts as binder material in molding sand. Moulding sand contains 2 â€“ 50% clay. When clay is mixed with water it imparts strength, plasticity and good binding strength. 
If clay content is increased in sand, it will increase its strength but decrease its permeability. There are two ingredients in clay:
 * 1. Fine silt     2.   True clay 
*In a mould sand true clay imparts the binding strength whereas fine silt has no effect on binding strength. Unlike sand, clay particles have flake like structure meaning that its surface area is much larger than thickness and these particles have great ability to hold/absorb moisture. 
Base sand brought directly from any source contains some amount of clay in it, but that amount may not be sufficient for making mould. Therefore, it becomes essential to determine the amount of clay present in it. After performing clay content test on base sand, one would be able to determine the amount of clay to be added/removed in order to establish a proper balance. 
When clay particles suspended in water reacts with sodium hydroxide, precipitation is formed which can be weighed using weighing scale.
