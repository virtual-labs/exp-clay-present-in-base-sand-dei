        "a": "To increase permeability",
        "b": "To act as a binder and provide strength",
        "c": "To reduce moisture content",
        "d": "To remove impurities from the sand"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Clay is essential in moulding sand as it binds sand particles together, providing necessary strength and plasticity to the mould.",

      "question": "What happens when clay is mixed with water? (LO1)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It hardens immediately",
        "b": "It dissolves completely",
        "c": "It becomes plastic and provides binding strength",
        "d": "It forms a porous structure"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "When clay absorbs water, it becomes plastic, meaning it can be shaped and will hold together under pressure.",
        "b": "When clay absorbs water, it becomes plastic, meaning it can be shaped and will hold together under pressure.",
        "c": "When clay absorbs water, it becomes plastic, meaning it can be shaped and will hold together under pressure.",
